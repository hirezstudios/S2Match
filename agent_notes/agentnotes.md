# SMITE 2 Match Data SDK - Agent Notes

## Project Structure
This project is a Python SDK for interacting with the RallyHere Environment API to access SMITE 2 match data. The main components are:

- `s2match.py`: The core SDK file with all API interactions and data transformations
- `s2match_examples.py`: Example script demonstrating SDK usage
- `items.json`: Data file used for enriching item information in match data
- `.env`: Configuration file with API credentials and settings
- `requirements.txt`: List of dependencies (requests, python-dotenv, pytest)
- `streamlit_app/`: Streamlit companion application for interactive exploration of the SDK

## Streamlit Companion App
We've developed a Streamlit companion app that provides an interactive interface for exploring the S2Match SDK capabilities:

- **Home**: Overview of the SDK and configuration options
- **Player Lookup**: Search for players by display name across platforms
- **Match History**: View detailed match data for a player with visualizations
- **Player Statistics**: Analyze player performance metrics
- **Full Player Data**: Comprehensive view of all player-related data
- **API Explorer**: Interactive interface for testing any SDK method

The app demonstrates how to use the SDK in a real application context and provides ready-to-use code examples.

## User Preferences
- The user prefers to verify functionality through example execution
- Testing approach is direct execution of examples to confirm API connectivity
- Python code should follow standard documentation practices with comprehensive docstrings
- Error handling and logging are important aspects of the SDK
- Visual exploration tools like the Streamlit app help showcase the SDK capabilities

## Technical Details
- The SDK uses the requests library for API interactions
- Authentication is handled via OAuth2 token-based auth
- Response caching is implemented to improve performance
- Rate limiting can be configured to avoid API throttling
- The SDK transforms raw API responses into a more usable format for SMITE 2 data
- The Streamlit app demonstrates data visualization techniques for the SDK's outputs

## Working Approach
For this project, we should:
1. Verify functionality through direct testing (already done)
2. Review code for documentation completeness
3. Consider adding more comprehensive test coverage
4. Look for opportunities to optimize performance or add helper methods
5. Ensure error handling is robust across all API interactions
6. Maintain and enhance the Streamlit companion app

## Current Status
- The core SDK functionality is working correctly and has been verified
- The Streamlit companion app is functional and includes all core pages
- Documentation has been updated to include information about the Streamlit app
- Basic testing has been implemented

## Next Steps
Based on our work so far, future sessions could focus on:
- Expanding test coverage for both the SDK and Streamlit app
- Adding more example use cases to the documentation
- Optimizing performance for high-volume requests
- Enhancing the Streamlit app with additional visualizations
- Implementing the SDK improvement ideas documented in notebook.md
- Deploying the Streamlit app to a public server for demos
