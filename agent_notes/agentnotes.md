# SMITE 2 Match Data SDK - Agent Notes

## Project Structure
This project is a Python SDK for interacting with the RallyHere Environment API to access SMITE 2 match data. The main components are:

- `s2match.py`: The core SDK file with all API interactions and data transformations
- `s2match_examples.py`: Example script demonstrating SDK usage
- `items.json`: Data file used for enriching item information in match data
- `.env`: Configuration file with API credentials and settings
- `requirements.txt`: List of dependencies (requests, python-dotenv, pytest)
- `streamlit_app/`: Streamlit companion application for interactive exploration of the SDK
- `test_s2match.py`: Unit tests for the SDK
- `run_tests.py`: Script to run all unit tests
- `agent_notes/`: Folder for project documentation and notes
  - `agentnotes.md`: Main project notes
  - `project_checklist.md`: Track progress on SDK improvements
  - `notebook.md`: Development notes and observations
  - `sdk_improvements.md`: List of planned SDK improvements

## Streamlit Companion App
We've developed a Streamlit companion app that provides an interactive interface for exploring the S2Match SDK capabilities:

- **Home**: Overview of the SDK and configuration options
- **Player Lookup**: Search for players by display name across platforms
- **Match History**: View detailed match data for a player with visualizations
- **Player Statistics**: Analyze player performance metrics
- **Full Player Data**: Comprehensive view of all player-related data
- **API Explorer**: Interactive interface for testing any SDK method

The app demonstrates how to use the SDK in a real application context and provides ready-to-use code examples.

## User Preferences
- The user prefers to verify functionality through example execution
- Testing approach is direct execution of examples to confirm API connectivity
- Python code should follow standard documentation practices with comprehensive docstrings
- Error handling and logging are important aspects of the SDK
- Visual exploration tools like the Streamlit app help showcase the SDK capabilities

## Technical Details
- The SDK uses the requests library for API interactions
- Authentication is handled via OAuth2 token-based auth
- Response caching is implemented to improve performance
- Rate limiting can be configured to avoid API throttling
- The SDK transforms raw API responses into a more usable format for SMITE 2 data
- The Streamlit app demonstrates data visualization techniques for the SDK's outputs

## Working Approach
For this project, we should:
1. Verify functionality through direct testing (already done)
2. Review code for documentation completeness
3. Consider adding more comprehensive test coverage
4. Look for opportunities to optimize performance or add helper methods
5. Ensure error handling is robust across all API interactions
6. Maintain and enhance the Streamlit companion app

## Current Status
- The core SDK functionality is working correctly and has been verified
- The Streamlit companion app is functional and includes all core pages
- Documentation has been updated to include information about the Streamlit app
- Basic testing has been implemented
- Added the Extract Player UUIDs Helper method from the SDK improvements list
- Created unit tests for the new helper method
- Updated examples to demonstrate the new helper method
- Integrated the Extract Player UUIDs Helper with the Streamlit app
- Updated the main README to document the new helper method
- Added the Match Filtering Helper method to filter match data by various criteria
- Created comprehensive unit tests for the Match Filtering Helper
- Updated examples to demonstrate the Match Filtering Helper
- Integrated the Match Filtering Helper with the Streamlit app
- Added the Player Performance Aggregation Helper method
- Created comprehensive unit tests for the performance calculations
- Updated examples to demonstrate the Player Performance Aggregation Helper
- Integrated the Player Performance Aggregation Helper with the Streamlit app
- Added the Flattened Player Lookup Response Helper method
- Created comprehensive unit tests for the flattening functionality
- Updated examples to demonstrate the Flattened Player Lookup Response Helper
- Integrated the Flattened Player Lookup Response Helper with the Streamlit app
- Added Enhanced Rate Limit Handling with exponential backoff
- Created comprehensive unit tests for the rate limit handling
- Updated examples to demonstrate the Enhanced Rate Limit Handling
- Added rate limit configuration options to the Streamlit app
- Added visualization of the backoff strategy to the Streamlit app

## Recent Improvements
1. Enhanced Rate Limit Handling - Added exponential backoff retry logic for handling rate limits (HTTP 429 responses) to make the SDK more robust in high-volume request scenarios
2. Flattened Player Lookup Response Helper - A helper method to transform the deeply nested player lookup response into a simple, flat list
3. Player Performance Aggregation Helper - Advanced analytics for player match data with metrics by god, mode, and role
4. Match Filtering Helper - Filter match data by various criteria (god, mode, date, performance metrics, etc.)
5. Extract Player UUIDs Helper - A helper method to extract all player UUIDs from a player lookup response

## Next Steps
Based on our work so far, our next priority is:

1. **Implement Enhanced Rate Limit Handling**: This will be the next SDK improvement to tackle. It will provide more robust handling of API rate limits with exponential backoff for retries.

Other future tasks include:
- Implementing the remaining SDK improvements from sdk_improvements.md:
  - Input Parameter Validation
- Expanding test coverage for both the SDK and Streamlit app
- Adding more example use cases to the documentation
- Optimizing performance for high-volume requests
- Enhancing the Streamlit app with additional visualizations
- Deploying the Streamlit app to a public server for demos
