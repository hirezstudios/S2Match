# SMITE 2 Match Data SDK - Agent Notes

## Project Structure
This project is a Python SDK for interacting with the RallyHere Environment API to access SMITE 2 match data. The main components are:

- `s2match.py`: The core SDK file with all API interactions and data transformations
- `s2match_examples.py`: Example script demonstrating SDK usage
- `items.json`: Data file used for enriching item information in match data
- `.env`: Configuration file with API credentials and settings
- `requirements.txt`: List of dependencies (requests, python-dotenv, pytest)

## User Preferences
- The user prefers to verify functionality through example execution
- Testing approach is direct execution of examples to confirm API connectivity
- Python code should follow standard documentation practices with comprehensive docstrings
- Error handling and logging are important aspects of the SDK

## Technical Details
- The SDK uses the requests library for API interactions
- Authentication is handled via OAuth2 token-based auth
- Response caching is implemented to improve performance
- Rate limiting can be configured to avoid API throttling
- The SDK transforms raw API responses into a more usable format for SMITE 2 data

## Working Approach
For this project, we should:
1. Verify functionality through direct testing (already done)
2. Review code for documentation completeness
3. Consider adding more comprehensive test coverage
4. Look for opportunities to optimize performance or add helper methods
5. Ensure error handling is robust across all API interactions

## Next Steps
Based on the initial testing, the SDK is functioning correctly. Future sessions could focus on:
- Expanding test coverage
- Adding more example use cases
- Optimizing performance for high-volume requests
- Enhancing documentation
