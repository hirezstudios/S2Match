## 2023-03-19: Enhanced Rate Limit Handling Implementation

Today we implemented the Enhanced Rate Limit Handling feature, which improves the SDK's resilience when dealing with API rate limits. This is an important improvement for production use cases where high-volume requests might trigger rate limiting from the RallyHere API.

### Implementation Notes

- Added new configuration parameters to the SDK constructor:
  - `max_retries`: Maximum number of retry attempts (default: 3)
  - `base_retry_delay`: Initial delay before first retry (default: 1.0 seconds)
  - `max_retry_delay`: Maximum delay between retries (default: 60.0 seconds)

- Created a robust exponential backoff algorithm with random jitter to prevent synchronized retries:
  - Formula: `min(base_delay * (2^retry_count), max_delay) ± jitter`
  - The jitter is calculated as ±20% of the delay to add randomization

- Implemented a powerful request wrapper method `_make_request_with_retry()` that:
  - Makes the initial API request
  - Automatically detects rate limit responses (HTTP 429)
  - Applies the backoff strategy and retries the request
  - Respects the `Retry-After` header if provided by the server
  - Properly handles error cases and exceptions

- Added comprehensive unit tests for all aspects of the rate limit handling:
  - Tests for backoff calculation
  - Tests for retry behavior with mock responses
  - Tests for Retry-After header handling

- Updated the Streamlit app with:
  - Configuration settings for rate limit parameters
  - An interactive visualization of the exponential backoff strategy
  - Proper display of rate limit status

### Observations

- The exponential backoff approach is much more robust than the previous simple fixed delay
- The implementation is non-invasive, gradually updating existing methods to use the new wrapper
- The proper handling of Retry-After headers ensures we comply with the server's requirements
- Error handling is comprehensive and provides clear logs for troubleshooting

### Next Steps

This implementation completes all the helper methods in our initial improvement plan. For future enhancements, we should consider:

1. More sophisticated rate limit tracking (per-endpoint limiting)
2. Improved error reporting and recovery mechanisms
3. Additional visualization tools for match data analysis

## 2023-03-19: Flattened Player Lookup Response Implementation

Today we implemented the Flattened Player Lookup Response Helper method, which simplifies the deeply nested player lookup response structure into a flat list of player objects. This helper addresses a common pain point when working with the player lookup endpoint.

### Implementation Notes

- Added the `flatten_player_lookup_response()` method to the S2Match class that:
  - Takes the complex nested response structure and transforms it to a simple list
  - Adds the display name to each player record for easier reference
  - Handles edge cases like empty responses properly
- Created comprehensive unit tests covering:
  - Normal case with multiple players
  - Empty response handling
  - Empty display_names list
  - Empty player arrays
- Updated the examples script with an example that shows both raw and flattened structures
- Enhanced the Streamlit app's Player Lookup page with a toggle to show either raw or flattened data

### Observations

- The flattened structure is much easier to work with in both code and UI contexts
- This simple transformation saves many lines of code when processing player lookup results
- The implementation is very lightweight with minimal overhead
- Adding the display_name directly to each player record eliminates the need to track it separately

### Next Steps

- Consider adding more transformation methods to simplify other complex responses
- Add sorting/filtering capabilities to the flattened list

## 2023-03-18: Player Performance Aggregation Implementation

Today we implemented the Player Performance Aggregation helper method to calculate comprehensive performance metrics from a player's match history. This makes it easy to get insights from match data with a single function call.

### Implementation Notes

- Added the `calculate_player_performance()` method to the S2Match class that:
  - Analyzes match data to produce various performance statistics
  - Calculates per-god statistics (win rates, KDA, etc.)
  - Calculates per-mode statistics (win rates, KDA, etc.)
  - Identifies favorite and best-performing gods and roles
- Created comprehensive unit tests covering:
  - Normal case with multiple matches
  - Cases with only losses or wins
  - Empty matches list
  - Various god and mode combinations
- Updated the Streamlit app to use this helper, significantly simplifying the Player Statistics page
- Added visualizations for god performance and mode performance

### Observations

- The consolidated statistics are much more informative than basic match data
- Identifying "best performing" vs "most played" gods provides valuable insights
- Performance by game mode helps identify player strengths across different scenarios
- Calculation is efficient and handles edge cases well

### Next Steps

- Consider adding more advanced metrics like damage per minute, gold per minute
- Add trend analysis to track improvement over time
- Consider adding percentile comparisons with global averages (if available)

## 2023-03-15: Match Filtering Helper Implementation

Today we added a match filtering helper method to the SDK that allows filtering match data by various criteria. This simplifies data analysis and helps extract relevant matches for specific scenarios.

### Implementation Notes

- Added the `filter_matches()` method to the S2Match class that:
  - Filters by god name
  - Filters by game mode
  - Filters by map
  - Filters by date range
  - Filters by win/loss status
  - Filters by performance metrics (kills, deaths, KDA, damage, etc.)
- Created comprehensive unit tests for each filter type and combinations
- Updated the Streamlit app to use this helper in the Match History page
- Added filter controls to the Streamlit UI

### Observations

- The filter implementation is very flexible and handles multiple criteria well
- Date range filtering required special handling for different date formats
- Performance metric filtering is particularly useful for finding standout matches
- The implementation properly handles edge cases like missing fields

### Next Steps

- Consider adding more filter types as needed
- Add support for OR conditions (currently all filters are AND)
- Consider adding regex/pattern matching for text fields

## 2023-03-12: Extract Player UUIDs Helper Implementation

Today we implemented the first helper method, `extract_player_uuids()`, which extracts all player UUIDs from a player lookup response. This simplifies a common operation when working with player data.

### Implementation Notes

- Added the method to the S2Match class to navigate the nested response structure
- Created unit tests to verify functionality with various response formats
- Updated the examples script to demonstrate usage
- Integrated with the Streamlit app in the Player Lookup page

### Observations

- The helper significantly reduces boilerplate code in applications
- It properly handles the nested nature of the API response
- Edge cases like missing fields are handled gracefully
- The implementation is lightweight and efficient

### Next Steps

- Continue implementing more helper methods to simplify common operations
- Consider adding more transformation methods for different response types

## Questions to Consider

1. Should we add a method to extract linked portal UUIDs specifically? This could be useful for getting all linked accounts for a player.

2. Should we add a method to extract all display names from a player lookup response? This could be useful for search results.

3. Are there other frequently used data extraction patterns that could benefit from helper methods?
