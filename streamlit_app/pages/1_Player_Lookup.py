    ### Player Lookup Methods
    
    The S2Match SDK provides several methods for looking up players:
    
    1. **`fetch_player_with_displayname`**: Look up players by display name, optionally filtering by platform.
       - Parameters: `display_names` (list of names), `platform` (optional), `include_linked_portals` (boolean)
       - Returns: Dictionary containing player information
    
    2. **`fetch_player_by_platform_user_id`**: Find a player by platform identity.
       - Parameters: `platform` (e.g., "Steam"), `platform_user_id` (platform-specific ID)
       - Returns: Dictionary with player information
    
    ### API Endpoints Used
    
    These methods interact with the following RallyHere Environment API endpoints:
    
    - `/users/v1/player` - Look up players by display name and platform
    - `/users/v1/player/{player_id}/linked_portals` - Get linked portal accounts for a player
    - `/users/v1/platform-user` - Find player by platform identity

### Raw vs. Flattened Response Structure
                
The player lookup endpoint returns data in a deeply nested structure that can be difficult to work with:
                
```python
{
    "display_names": [
        {
            "PlayerName": [
                {
                    "player_uuid": "uuid_string",
                    "player_id": 12345,
                    "platform": "Steam",
                    "linked_portals": [...]
                }
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```
                
The `flatten_player_lookup_response` helper method transforms this into a much simpler flat list:
                
```python
[
    {
        "display_name": "PlayerName",
        "player_uuid": "uuid_string",
        "player_id": 12345,
        "platform": "Steam",
        "linked_portals": [...]
    }
]
```

- Iterate through players with a simple loop
- Filter and sort player data
